## "Where is my executable!"

`make` stops when the compiler finds a compilation error, so the final executable cannot be made. Fix all compilation errors and try once more.

{: .important}
Compilation *warnings* are usually excused by the compiler and the executable might be made. As good practice, the goal is the most quiet compilation with no warnings either, so fix warnings as well.
