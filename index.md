# This is a landing page.

A website about CSE13S @ UCSC.[^1] *The* 13S.

A class where you learn the C programming language, UNIX, tools like `make`, and put your life on pause for 10 weeks.

Most of the pages on this site were written during Fall 2023. If you find any errors or would like to contribute[^2], feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/sneha-afk/13s-docs/).

## Recommended resources
1. The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
    * Nearly always required in a C class!
    * **"reading in a CS class?1!!"** Fine, but I highly recommend reading chapter 8 about using C with UNIX.
    * The 2nd edition is written for the ANSI standard which is most common, but the 1st edition is alright.
2. [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/), short and interactive
3. [Jess's site][Jess's site], featuring many more guides and walkthroughs!
